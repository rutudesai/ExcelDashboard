Dashboard of City Bikes Analysis in Excel

With the help of Alex Freberg (Alex The Analyst), created a Dynamic Dashboard in Microsoft Excel.
The dataset included different features including : 
1) ID, 
2) Marital Status,
3) Gender,
4) Income,
5) Children, 
6) Education,
7) Occupation, 
8) Home Owner, 
9) Cards, 
10) Commute Distnace,
11) Region,
12) Age,
13) Purchased Bike (target variable)

To create the Dashboard, had to clean the data first. The process of cleaning included :
1) Finding Duplicates and removing those rows.
2) Converted Categorical Variables into more readable format , i.e in Gender we had M/F, byt converted it to Male/Female.
3) Making Column Values uniform.
4) Added Categories to Numeric Columns with Nested IF.
5) Created Pivot Tables and made Charts.
